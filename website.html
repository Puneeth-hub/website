		 <h3>Editor Tagging</h3>
		 <p>Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was 
		 born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, 
		 and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a 
		 curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with 
		 which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.</p>
		 <p>Don't bother typing “lorem ipsum” into Google translate. If you already tried, you may have gotten anything from "NATO" to "China", depending on how you capitalized the letters. The bizarre translation was fodder for conspiracy theories, but Google has since updated its “lorem ipsum” translation to, boringly enough, “lorem ipsum”.</p>
